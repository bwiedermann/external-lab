# External DSLs

## Getting the code

Follow the assignment workflow: fork to GitHub, then clone to your machine. 

Alternatively, you can [download the code](https://github.com/hmc-cs111-fall2014/external-lab/archive/master.zip) and work locally.

## Working on the lab

Extend the code to implement the following grammar:
```
        n ‚àà ùíµ 
e ‚àà Expr ::= e + t | e - t | t
t ‚àà Term ::= t * f | t / f | f
f ‚àà Fact ::= n | ( e )
```

It's best to add features in the following order:
   1. subtraction
   2. multiplication
   3. division
   4. parenthetical expressions

When you add a new feature to a language, extend the implemention in the following order:
   1. Intermediate representation
      1. Data structures
      2. Sugar (if you want)
   2. Parser
      1. Tests
      2. Implementation
   3. Semantics
      1. Tests
      2. Implementation

## Bonus
If you finish (or just want to explore things more), here are some options.

### Better error-checking
Can you give better error-checking and error messages for the parser? For the read-eval-print loop? You could also write one or more semantic checks: a pass over the AST to check for errors, e.g., divide by literal 0.

### More features
You could add more features to the language, including
  - comparisons, e.g., `<`, `>`, `=`, etc.
  - constants, e.g., built-in names such as `œÄ` or `e`
